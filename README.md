Image Search Using AI Object Detection, CDN & Elasticsearch

This workflow lets you build a smart image search system powered by AI and automation no manual tagging needed. It detects, crops, and indexes objects from images so you can search them easily later.

 What It Does

Detects objects in any image using AI-based object detection.

Crops and uploads detected items to Cloudinary (CDN) for quick access.

Stores image metadata and labels in Elasticsearch for fast, content-based search.

Automates the full process â€” from image analysis to searchable database creation.

 Use Cases

E-commerce: Auto-detect and catalog products from photos.

Content Moderation: Identify restricted or unwanted objects in uploads.

Media & DAM Systems: Organize and tag thousands of images automatically.

AI Training Data: Create labeled datasets of cropped objects.

Visual Search Engines: Enable object-based image search and indexing.
